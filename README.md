# JBus_communication_Python

Everything you need to establish a basic communication with an UPS via Python code.

## Description

This project started in February 2020 and ended in March 2020 due to lack of interest. So I decided to publish the code, hoping it can be useful for other people.  
The **UPS Communication Class** (`ups_comunication_class.py`) works pretty well, but it lacks a perfect error checking, and needs a lot of improvements.  
The **low level packet generator** (`jbus.py`) is working without problems and has been tested for many hours continuously.

## Little warning ;-)
_Before uploading the project to GitHub I added a lot of comments. I hope I haven't damaged anything on the code, but if so, these are errors that can be easily solved._
