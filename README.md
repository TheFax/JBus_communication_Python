# JBus_communication_Python

Everything you need to establish a basic communication with a Socomec UPS.

This project started in February 2020 and ended in March 2020 due to lack of interest. So I decided to publish them, hoping they can be useful for other people.  
The **UPS Communication Class** works pretty well, but it lacks a perfect error checking.  
The low level **jbus.py** are working without problems and has been tested for many hours continuously.

## Little warning ;-)
_Before uploading the project to GitHub I added a lot of comments. I hope I haven't damaged anything on the code, but if so, these are errors that can be easily solved._
